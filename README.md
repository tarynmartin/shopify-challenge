<!-- Brief Description -->

## Brief Description
This is an app that allows a user to search for movies by title and allows the user to nominate up to 5 movies for The Shoppies. Site is responsive and received 100 for accessibility through lighthouse.

## How to use
User searches for movies by title. When they see a movie they want to nominate, they click the nominate movie. When a movie is nominated, the nominate button for that movie is disabled. If they decided to remove a nomination, they can click on the remove button on the nominations list.

When a user reaches 5 nominations, a banner pops up telling them they can't add more and the nomination buttons disappear.

If a user leaves the page and returns, their previous nominations will be retrieved and displayed.

## Next Steps
